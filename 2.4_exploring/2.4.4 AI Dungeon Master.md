The AI Dungeon Master ("**DM**") tracks the party's progress through the overall level. Each time the party progresses to a new **Level Quad**, the DM will reduce each player's intensity level. See: [[2.4.4.1 Intensity]].

After one member of the party's intensity level crosses a certain threshold, the DM will give the overall party a break and instead place some non-combat types of [[2.4.4.2 Encounters]] along their path. These may unwittingly lead to combat though, maybe a friendly druid would become angry through some heated conversation!

The decay of intensity is spatial rather than temporal, so that rushing through the level is not beneficial (though neither is slowing down). Instead, the only variable is how the player's are performing in [[2.5 Combat ðŸŒŒ]].
