Procedurally generated levels allows players to experience different layouts and challenges each time they play. The levels are generated based on region, then by biome, then by the available nodes.

**Procedural randomness** is a technique that game designers can use to introduce a element of unpredictability into a game, which can increase replayability by making each playthrough feel different. 

**Procedural randomness** is achieved by using algorithms to generate random elements of the game, such as levels, enemies, or events, rather than hard-coding them.

Some examples of how **procedural randomness** can be used to increase replayability in a game include:
1. [[2.4.2 Procedural Level Generation]]
2. Randomised [[Encounters]]: Adds an element of unpredictability to the game and makes player retention higher.
