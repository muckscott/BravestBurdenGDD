> If players end up dying for the good of the Soul Fire (and by extension their allies), the game's intended experience has been met.

The Soul Fire is the ultimate quest of the players. They protect and guide it through a dark and hopeless realm, either becoming the beacon that they dutifully share or learning how to use its immense power as their own.

Should they fail to protect or aid it, it may turn to a state of Chaos which will be tricky to de-escalate. If de-escalated, the rest of the expedition will be significantly more difficult as players manage a new Burden.

The Soul Fire doubles up as a means to keep the players together, by providing visibility and accessibility rules by having an Aura.
