> In many ways it is better to lose a companion and subsequently find means to revive them than to have the Soul Fire enter the state of Chaos.

When a Soul Fire is extinguished is it will enter a state of chaos, which makes the situation very dire, as the soul fire will be unpredictable and highly dangerous.
The type of chaos state that the fire will enter is determined at the beginning of the expedition, but not revealed except through some skills.
Once cleansed of the chaos, the soul fire inflicts a burden on the party for the remainder of the expedition.
This outcome can happen multiple times if the soul fire is repeatedly extinguished.
