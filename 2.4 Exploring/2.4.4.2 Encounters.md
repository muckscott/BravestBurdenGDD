**Encounters** are obstacles or moments of special interest within the game world. Multi-phase encounters are possible, if one can be the setup for another.

Encounters are placed inside of [[2.4.2.3 Level Nodes]]. 
Notably, these are not inside of [[2.4.2.4 Level Quads]] as this would provide less opportunity for variety based on the composition of the **Node**.
