**Items** can be used during gameplay by accessing the [[Inventory]]. They can be found in the game world, given as quest rewards, or dropped by fallen enemies.

The intention is that these will not be used during combat, but instead during moments of down-time or moments where the players make a concerted effort to take stock of what they can use.

[[2.1.1.1 Camping]] also gives players some time to sort their items - the hope is that they will spend less time doing this during active parts of the game such as travel or combat. #design-theory
