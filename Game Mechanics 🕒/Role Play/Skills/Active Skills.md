Players have access to [[Active Skills]] which they must can unlock after [[2.2.4.1 Levelling Up]] during [[2.1.1.5 Sleep]].

Players have access to *4* [[Active Skills]] at a time, and their #choice dictates which type of those skills to bring. These can only be chosen while [[2.1.1.1 Camping]]. 

These skills would still be either **adventure**, **combat** or **soul-fire** skills. 

> It is up to the player how to compose their character: whether they will offer more utility outside of combat; more prowess during combat; or more ability related towards care and utilisation of the **Light**.
