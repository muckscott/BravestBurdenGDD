You encounter an archway.
An apparition appears.
It explains you may enter the archway to pass through to the otherside.
But no word should be spoken by any player.
If any player speaks, or pings, then they will be ravaged by Wraiths. Worsens each time.
Once they reach the other side they can resume speech.

*Note: need a way to force communication. A puzzle?*
