**Intro:**
Meet a panicked traveller, saying they are being tracked.
They ask where have you come from, is it safe?
Say Sylvangrove, make something up, (or don't)..
The traveller will scurry off quickly.

**Meet a Bounty Hunter seeking his mark:**
Attacking him twice is almost guaranteed to be a group wipe.
Navigate the conversation.
Give him the information, or not?
Correct information will get you some coin.
Either way, chance to get a Trait.

If you don't give up the information, someone will be robbed in Sylvangrove & a quest will be available for recovering the treasure.
