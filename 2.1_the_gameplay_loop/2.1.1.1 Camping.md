In general, **Camping** is a leisurely five - ten minutes where players can: 
- Sleep or Meditate:
	- Make character choices such as their [[Traits]] and [[2.2.4.2a Skill Unlocks ðŸ’¤]].
	- Receive a buff.
- Manage their [[Items]]:
	- Rearrange inventory space.
	- Destroy or drop.
- Cook and eat food:
	- Recover [[2.5.2.1 Health]].
	- Receive [[Buff Ideas]].
- Participate in any available [[Mini-games]]:
	- Depends where in the world you are.
	- Depends which NPCs are present.

The **duration** of this phase depends on the [[Party]] as players can choose to end it early at the [[2.1.1.4 Campfire]]. Each player readying up will remove some of the total time given to the phase. If all players are ready, it will end immediately.
