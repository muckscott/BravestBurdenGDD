**Sleep** is performed at the [[2.1.1.2 Campsites]] and is an opportunity for players to restore [[2.5.2 Combat Resources ðŸ’¤]] as well as select their [[2.2.4.2a Skill Unlocks ðŸ’¤]] and [[Traits]].

The flow of **Sleep** is as follows:
1. The player may unlock any new [[Traits]] earned by completing [[Achievements]].
2. The player may unlock [[2.2.4.2a Skill Unlocks ðŸ’¤]] earned by [[2.2.4.1 Levelling Up]] - typically this presents a #choice.
3. The player may select their [[2.2.4.2a Skill Unlocks ðŸ’¤]] to be taken on their next trip.
4. The player may change *1* of their [[Traits]] for another.
