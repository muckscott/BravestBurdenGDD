Upon reaching a **Campsite**, the players must endeavour to make it safe by clearing the area of [[2.5.4 Enemies]]. They must also set up the camp by completing whichever objective is present for that site, which could be something like setting up a tent, or laying traps around the perimeter, for example. These objective could be any of the [[Encounters]].
