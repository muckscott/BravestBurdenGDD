Encountering a new place to camp is the goal from the moment the [[Party]] sets out. 

Upon reaching a **Campsite**, the players must endeavour to make it safe by [[2.1.1.3 Setting Up Camp]]. 

When the objective is completed the campfire is lit, and this cleanses all [[2.3.7 Burdens]] and players are then given a chance to relax & recover during the [[2.1.1.1 Camping]] phase.
