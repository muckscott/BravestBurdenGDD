Every unit in the game has a courage resource from 0 to 100. 
When this reaches certain thresholds, effects can be triggered. 
For players, this ties in with their primary Trait and is a debuff to ensure sharing of the Soul Fire. 
For enemies, it could be a new combat form or ability unlocked, as the enemy would have had the Soul Fire for a significant amount of time.
