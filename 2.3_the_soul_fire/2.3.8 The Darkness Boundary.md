The Darkness Boundary is a mechanic which stops players wandering too far from the Soul Fire. Going into this will not allow the player to have visibility beyond their outline. They will lose **Courage** rapidly, and begin to lose **Health**. The Boundary is very obvious and moves along with the fire.
