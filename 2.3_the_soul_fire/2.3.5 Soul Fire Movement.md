The soul fire can be moved by the current bearer.

Each class moves the Soul Fire in a different way:
- The **Brute** embodies it for a duration, gaining a lot of attention but stopping any interceptions. During this time, their courage is drained more rapidly. After they have used all courage, the fire is dropped.
- The **Ranger** can shoot it to a new position very accurately, and through enemies.
- The **Druid** can move it directly while in a trance-like state themselves. It is ownerless during this, and will be picked up by any unit that tries to.
- The **Thief** can drop it while temporarily hiding it. It is also the only class which can steal it from allies / enemies within a short range. Thieves automatically drop it when they run out of Courage.

The fire may also choose to move itself in order to go where it feels it will be safer. However, this stops while any player bearer is using their class skill.
