**Lives** are a resource which prevent [[2.5.3 Death ✏️]] so long as the Game Unit can be downed (and they are not already).

Upon entering the [[2.5.3.1 Downed State]], the unit loses 1 life.
Upon [[2.5.3 Death ✏️]], the unit loses all **Lives**. 

This mechanic was created to prevent players from cheesing the mechanic for more health. 
After running out of **Lives**, they will reach [[2.5.3 Death ✏️]] instantly.
