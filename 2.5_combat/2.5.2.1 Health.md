**Health** is a resource which dictates how close to [[2.5.3 Death ✏️]] a particular Game Unit is.

**Health** can only be directly restored using either [[Healing Items]] or some [[2.4.6 Interactions]] in the game world, both of which take time (so that they cannot be performed while unsafe).

When a Game Unit runs out of this, if it has more than 0 [[2.5.2.4 Lives]] and is able to be [[Downed]] then the Game Unit will go to the [[2.5.3.1 Downed State]].  Otherwise, the Game Unit will reach [[2.5.3 Death ✏️]].

Some ways during [[Combat]] to avoid running out of **Health** are:
- [[2.5.2.3 Temporary Health]] can be given by using certain [[2.2.4.2a Skill Unlocks 💤]].
- [[Buff Ideas]] could be given which temporarily increase the maximum **Health** a unit has, or mitigates certain types of [[Damage]]
