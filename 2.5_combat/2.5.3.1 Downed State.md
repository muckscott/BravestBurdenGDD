The **Downed State** is a vulnerable state before [[2.5.3 Death ✏️]]. Upon entering this state the unit loses 1 of their [[2.5.2.4 Lives]].

If the Game Unit runs out of the [[2.5.2.3 Temporary Health]] granted by this state, they reach [[2.5.3 Death ✏️]]. 

Otherwise, if the condition required for them to return to normal state is reached, they are saved from [[2.5.3 Death ✏️]] and granted full health [[2.5.2.1 Health]] with some [[2.5.7.4a Mortality]] applied.

> **Example**
> Players return to their normal state by after an ally helps them up (an **Interaction**).
