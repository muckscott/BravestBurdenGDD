Giving players the opportunity to progress and unlock new content or rewards can encourage replayability, as players will want to continue playing in order to unlock these rewards.

[[2.2.4.2b Randomised Item Drops]] give variety to the progression based on the player's unique experience whereas players choosing their progress with [[2.2.4.2a Skill Unlocks ðŸ’¤]]  via [[2.2.4.1 Levelling Up]]  players will differ based on set choices during their characters growth. Lastly, [[2.2.4.2c Character Traits]] are awarded after achieving certain milestones in-game, based on their behaviour. This is a feedback to the player of how the game is identifying their playstyle.
