**Temporary Health** is health which decays over time. Given a Game Unit has this, it will always be removed before any non-temporary [[2.5.2.1 Health]].

**Temporary Health** added to non-temporary health cannot exceed the maximum health limit.

> **Example** 
> Using a **Skill** which gives **20** temporary health to an Ally on an Ally with **90/100** health would grant **10 temporary health**.
